# Thesis

Parts 1 and 2 are most important: what are you doing & why.  Explain to reader what your work is.

1. Intro & Motivation
  * what & why…
  * aims & objectives…
2. Techincal Background
  * algorithms & CS techniques
  * previous work
  * technologies

3. Execution
4. Evaluation 
  * critique

5. Conclusions

The evaluation is more important than the execution.  You have either done what you have said or not!  Part 4 describes whether you can be critical and rate what you have done in comparison to what is out there.  Make broad statements about the future.

Evaluation can be negative so long as you have the facts to back it up.  'X doesn't work because technique Y can easily detect it with 98% probability' is fine… 'This is rubbish' isn't.

Don't be shy to be critical of existing work!

Conclusions should refer back to your aims.  Don't be 'if I had more time I'd have…', say 'I did aim 1 in section 3.2…'.

Get parts one and two done ASAP.  The better you can organise the first bit the better your thesis should end up.

*By January…* aim to have a draft of sections one and two; and aim to rip each others to pieces (for criticism!)
